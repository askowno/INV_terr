Workflows for including Invasive Alien Plant distribution and abundance data into ecosystem assessments for terrestrial ecosystems in South Africa
Part of the National Biodiversity Assessment 2025
a) National Invasive Alien Plant survey data (Kotze 2023) supplied by DFFE (Andrew Wannenburg) 
b) Western  Cape Invasive ALien Tree survey (Rebelo 2024) 

The outputs are invasive alien plant severity and extent data for each terrestrial ecosystem (vegetation type) 

The analysis involved cross tabulating (in R terra) the above invasives data with vegetation (National Vegetation Map 2025) and  
land cover 2022 (SANBI nlc2022 based on SACALC 2022 (DFFE))
